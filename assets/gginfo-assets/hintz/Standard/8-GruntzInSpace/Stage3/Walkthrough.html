    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5" width="75%">
      <tr> 
        <td><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pick up the megaphone, walk down the 
          corridor and hit the left black one switch. Pick up another megaphone 
          and get the gauntletz. Wait near the arrows. The other grunt walks down, 
          hits the right black one switch and gets gauntletz. Smash the ice cubes 
          opposite the second enemy gun hat grunt and you'll find a beach ball. 
          Walk over the spikes and smash all the ice cubes at the opposite side. 
          Avoid being hit by the enemy gun hat gruntz. When all ice cubes are 
          gone, get the gravity bootz from the resourcez. Give the beach ball 
          to the enemy sword gruntz and walk onto the green hold switch. Meanwhile 
          the gauntletz grunt walks to third arrow from the top. As soon as the 
          gauntletz grunt passes the first two-way arrow, the bootz grunt waits 
          in front of&nbsp; the silver pyramids. The gauntletz grunt kills the 
          two enemy gun hat gruntz and hits the timer switch. The bootz grunt 
          starts walking, but watch out, there is a delay on the second pyramid 
          from the right. </font> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Smash the ice cubes for some more zap 
            cola and smash the giant ice rock revealing some switches. Step on 
            the purple switches so the warpstone grunt can proceed to the next 
            pyramid. Now hit the green toggle switch and get across to the spiky 
            area. The bootz grunt passes the search light and proceeds to the 
            red toggle switch. The gauntletz grunt first smashes the ice cube 
            in the upper left hand corner, collects a coin and then walks down. 
            Smash the ice cubes there, get the zap cola and the coin and walk 
            back again. Now walk over the pyramids, pass through the search light 
            and smash all ice cubes around the goober straw and the puddlez, wait 
            on the red toggle switch. The bootz grunt picks up the goober straw 
            and sucks up the four puddlez. Put a new grunt on the creation pad, 
            get the shovel and close all the holes. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The gauntletz grunt smashes the ice 
            cubes and the giant ice rock. Together hit the purple switches, move 
            the warpstone grunt and proceed to the checkpoint. Put the straw grunt 
            and the gauntletz grunt on the green hold switches behind the lava. 
            The shovel grunt passes the lava and the pyramids. As soon as he hits 
            the last pyramid the enemy gun hat gruntz starts shooting. Kill them 
            both and hit the black one switch. The gauntletz grunt and the straw 
            grunt pass the lava. The gauntletz grunt smashes all the timebombed 
            ice cubes in the corner, the straw grunt gets the wingz! </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Put the gauntletz grunt and the shovel 
            grunt near the orange switches. The wingz grunt walks back towards 
            the&nbsp;checkpoint, walks down and </font><a
    href="space_w302.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">flies over the pool towards 
            the orange pyramids.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Cross 
            the rolling rocks while the other gruntz bring down the pyramids. 
            Walk around the pool and fly towards the spring. Hit the black one 
            switch behind&nbsp;the other pool so the other gruntz can get across 
            too. The gauntletz grunt smashes the giant ice rock and hits the checkpoint. 
            The shovel grunt closes some holes and together with the spring grunt 
            he hits the purple switches. The warpstone grunt can proceed to the 
            next pyramid. You don't need the shovel grunt from now on. The spring 
            grunt jumps back through the spiky area, goes downstairs, picks up 
            a coin and waits near the search light. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now the gauntletz grunt enters the 
            blue warp. Hit the three black one switches in the area with the fast 
            spinning&nbsp;search light. The center is a safe spot, use it! Proceed 
            towards the silver pyramids. The grunt just released hits the green 
            toggle switch and runs towards the pyramids too. The rock hits the 
            timer switch and as soon as the pyramids go down </font><a href="space_w303.html"><font size="2"
    face="Verdana">both gruntz enter the pyramid maze.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
            Position one grunt in front of a two-way arrow, the other hits the 
            green toggle switch and both run towards the purple switches and wait 
            there until the rocks smash against the pyramids! Don't hit the black 
            one switches! The barehanded grunt gets the sponge gun, picks up the 
            megaphone and hits the green toggle switch.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">An alternative solution (probably not 
            intended by the game designers) is to position the gauntletz grunt 
            near the green toggle switch and the barehand grunt near a two-way 
            arrow switch. The gauntletz grunt hits the green toggle switch as 
            soon as the barehanded grunt has passed the two-way arrow and <strong>before</strong> 
            the rock reaches the bottom green toggle switch he hits it again. 
            This locks the two rocks so the barehanded grunt can get the megaphone 
            and the sponge gun without any hurry. After he has picked up these 
            objects the gauntletz grunt hits the green toggle switch again. Hitting 
            the black one switches doesn't do any harm anymore.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Get the yo-yo and give it to the enemy 
            sword grunt. Both gruntz go downstairs, walk around the space, say 
            hello to the spring grunt who should be waiting there and release 
            the barehanded grunt by stepping on the purple switches. Hit the green 
            toggle switch below and all gruntz proceed towards the green warp. 
            The gauntletz grunt smashes all timebombed ice cubes he can reach 
            and then one by one you enter the green warp. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Put the gauntletz grunt on the green 
            hold switch in the upper right hand corner. The sponge grunt goes 
            to the lower left hand switch. The barehanded grunt steps on the arrows, 
            as soon as he has passed the first two-way arrow the sponge grunt 
            walks to the right switch and the gauntletz grunt walks to the left 
            switch. The barehanded grunt picks up the sponge gun and all gruntz 
            proceed to the next area. Shoot the gauntletz grunt and a sponge grunt 
            over the arrow. They step on the purple switches so the other gruntz 
            can proceed too. Smash all the ice cubes, save some zap cola, you 
            may need it later on.&nbsp; </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now kill the two enemy boxing gruntz 
            and step on the arrows in the corner. Both sponge gruntz walk towards 
            the arrows too, together </font><a
    href="space_w304.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">they get the warp letter.</font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"> The gauntletz grunt passes the rolling rocks and 
            is shot over the arrow by one of the sponge gruntz. Get the spinning 
            wheel, make the boxing gruntz follow you and have them killed by the 
            rolling rocks. Walk over the black one switch, smash the giant ice 
            rock and wait on the green hold switch. A sponge grunt and the spring 
            grunt go downstairs, follow the corridor and step on the purple switches. 
            The warpstone grunt can proceed to the castle.&nbsp;The sponge grunt 
            shoots the spring grunt over the arrow onto the green hold switch. 
            The sponge grunt hits the black one switch and walks back again. The 
            spring grunt now </font><a href="space_r3.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">triggers 
            the red warp.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Afterwards 
            the spring grunt is shot back over the arrow and waits near the checkpoint. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The gauntletz grunt walks back and 
            together with a sponge grunt he proceeds towards the checkpoint. After 
            hitting the checkpoint the gauntletz gruntz hits </font><a href="space_w301.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">the 
            timebombed radioactive pile.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
            The spring gruntz now passes the blue toggle switch and proceeds to 
            the spiky area near the fortress. </font><a
    href="space_w305.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here he jumps through 
            the spiky area and waits on the green hold switch.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Back to the gauntletz grunt who walks 
            back to the island with the single ice cub and smashes it. <b>Don't 
            hit&nbsp;</b> </font><a href="space_s3.html"><font

            Both the gauntletz grunt and the sponge grunt enter the green warp. 
            The gauntletz gruntz steps on the arrows, while he's walking around 
            the sponge grunt shoots him towards the center black one switch, then 
            the left one and finally the right one. Smash the timebombed ice cubes. 
            Both gruntz proceed to the rolling rocks and </font><a href="space_w307.html"><font

            hit the green toggle switch, wait until all rocks have disappeared 
            into space, then hit it again. The second grunt just has to follow 
            the two-way arrows towards the search light. Both gruntz pass the 
            rocks and </font><a href="space_w308.html"><font
