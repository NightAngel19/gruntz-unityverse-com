      <tr> 
        <td><font size="2" face="Verdana">One grunt leaves the platform and steps 
          on the green hold switch below. The other grunt leaves the platform, 
          walks down and waits on the red hold switch where he's locked for the 
          time being. Now you're gauntletz grunt kills the four enemy boxing gruntz, 
          watch out for the arrows! He walks back a little and smashes all the 
          timebombed ice cubes. Now he walks back to the beginning and waits near 
          the locked grunt. The barehanded grunt gets the goober straw and the 
          baby-walker and sucks up the four puddlez. Sneak past the enemy sword 
          grunt and get the coin behind the lava. Now you give the baby-walker 
          toy to the sword grunt, quickly get the coin behind the satellite, hit 
          the checkpoint and go downstairs where you hit the black one switch.

    size="2" face="Verdana">Put a new grunt on the creation pad. Just drop your 
            new grunt onto the enemy sword grunt! The gauntletz grunt passes the 
            lava and smashes the ice cubes in front of the two purples switches. 
            Together hit the purple switches. You're barehanded grunt steps on 
            the blue hold switch. Now the straw grunt enters the blue warp. During 
            the fight with the enemy toob grunt walk towards the zap cola. Now

    face="Verdana"> Go upstairs and kill the enemy welder grunt. First get the 
            gauntletz behind the three enemy welder gruntz. Just avoid them, there's 
            no need to fight. Walk back, cross the three arrows and smash the 
            two bottom ice cubes. Get the roidz powerup and kill the two enemy 
            spring gruntz. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Proceed downwards and step on the green 
            toggle switch. Run to the upper right black one switch and zigzag 
            downwards over the other switches. Keep ahead of the rock! Smash all 
            the ice cubes, some are timebombed, but&nbsp;watch out for the enemy 
            gun hat grunt. Don't pick up the invisibility powerup yet, but proceed 
            smashing the ice cubes&nbsp;downwards until you got a coin. Now smash 
            the timebombed ice cube at the other side of the blocks too,&nbsp;this 
            is </font><a href="space_r2.html"><font size="2"
    face="Verdana">the red warp trigger.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
            Now walk back, get the invisibility powerup, go upstairs to the right,&nbsp;hit 
            the black one switch and keep on walking towards the end of the platform. 
            A coin is hidden behind the satellite.&nbsp;Go upstairs to the platform 
            with the search lights and wait on the black one switch. Don't fight 
            the enemy shovel gruntz! </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now back to the barehanded grunt waiting 
            on the blue hold switch. He gets the yo-yo, walks down the corridor 
            and picks up the megaphone. Go upstairs and step on the green hold 
            switch. As the enemy sword grunt spots you, step one pass back and 
            as soon as he hits the green hold switch, give him the yo-yo and proceed 
            to the blue warp. Get the coin in the lava maze, walk back and go 
            to the other side of the maze, wait here. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Back to the beginning where you have 
            two gruntz waiting on the purple switches. Give the barehanded one 
            gauntletz from the resourcez and together proceed to the checkpoint. 
            As soon as you step on this checkpoint the enemy rock grunt attacks. 
            Just step aside and hit the checkpoint again. Both gruntz proceed 
            down the corridor and kill the welder grunt. Smash all ice cubes and 
            you'll find zap cola and a coin. Now step on the green hold switch. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The barehanded grunt, waiting near 
            the lava maze, steps on the orange switch and back again. One of the 
            gauntletz gruntz passes the search light, smashes an ice cube and 
            walks straight forward into the narrow corridor. A megaphone is hidden 
            behind the satellite. Walk back and smash the red brick on your left. 
            Return to the gauntletz grunt. Now the gauntletz grunt walks around 
            the open space towards the&nbsp;second enemy wingz grunt, just ignore 
            the first one. Smash the ice cubes and hit </font><a
    href="space_s2.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">the secret ? switch.</font></a><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"> </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Walk back, press the orange switch 
            and both gruntz proceed towards the two green hold switches. Now continue 
            with the grunt waiting near the lava maze. Enter the maze again and 
            walk towards the stairs. Here you pick up the invulnerability powerup, 
            hit the black one switch, go downstairs and pass the lava towards 
            the timer switch. Hit the timer switch, one of your other gruntz passes 
            the silver pyramids at the left hand side, meanwhile you hit the red 
            hold switch so he can get through. Do the same thing for the other 
            grunt. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The gauntletz grunt hits the black 
            one switch. Walk back and pass the narrow corridor at the bottom. 
            The other barehanded grunt picks up the boomerang and waits on the 
            left green hold switch. The gauntletz grunt hits the timer switch 
            twice so the grunt arrives at the first green pyramids. Now he hits 
            the switch for the third time and immediately proceeds to the right 
            green hold switch. Finally the boomerang grunt hits the timer switch 
            and your through. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The boomerang grunt hits the enemy 
            bomb grunt. He blows up both the sword grunt and himself. Now you 
            can hit the black one switch and enter the blue warp. Get the shovel 
            from the resourcez. Walk around the castle and wait near the warpstone. 
            The gauntletz grunt enters the platform with the enemy wingz gruntz. 
            The easiest way to kill them is having them fly above a hole while 
            they attack. Smash all ice cubes, hit the green toggle switch in the 
            upper left hand corner, hit the black on switch and in the same area 
            in the upper left hand corner collect a coin. Both the gauntletz and 
            the boomerang grunt proceed towards the moving bridge. You have to 
            zigzag over the breakable parts to get across. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now the shovel grunt steps on the blue 
            hold switch and the gauntletz grunt crosses the bridge. He kills both 
            the enemy gun hat gruntz. Put the gauntletz grunt and the boomerang 
            grunt on the purple switches. The shovel grunt closes the holes and 
            </font><a href="space_r2.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">triggers 
            the red warp.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Pick up the 
            warpstone piece and go back to the castle. Hit the timer switch and 
            enter the castle at the left through the center pyramid.</font>
