      <tr> 
        <td><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pick up the gravity bootz and walk towards 
          the green hold switch. When he's almost there the barehanded grunt walks&nbsp;towards 
          the black one switch at the bottom. After hitting it he goes downstairs 
          again and waits in front of the spikes. The bootz grunt hits the black 
          one switch on the left and crosses the arrows towards the moving bridge. 
          In the middle of the bridge just walk into the water towards the orange 
          switch. Throughout this level you have to hit a total of six orange 
          switches to reach </font><a href="space_s4.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">the 
          secret ? switch.</font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"> </font> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After hitting the switch walk back 
            to the bridge, proceed to the checkpoint and pick up the sponge gun. 
            First shoot the right enemy sponge grunt into the hole. Now walk to 
            the single arrow near the orange switch. As the enemy sponge grunt 
            is ready to shoot step on the arrow and when the shot arrives step 
            on it again. You'll be shot onto the orange switch. Now you can shoot 
            the left enemy sponge grunt into the hole. The barehanded grunt walks 
            towards the checkpoint. Shoot him over the arrow to the gauntletz 
            and together hit the checkpoint. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The gauntletz grunt crosses over the 
            upper part of the breakable bridge and waits in front of the arrow. 
            The sponge grunt sacrifices himself, he walks over the green toggle 
            switch towards the end of the bridge and shoots on the arrow. The 
            gauntletz grunt steps on the arrow and waits on the green hold switch 
            until the rock has passed the green pyramid. Pass the pyramids and 
            smash the four ice cubes, revealing a blue toggle switch. Hit the 
            switch and proceed to the platform with the single enemy sponge grunt. 
            Kill him, smash the ice cubes, get the zap cola and hit the black 
            one switch.&nbsp;Walk back and proceed to the next bridge. Smash all 
            the ice cubes, you'll find zap cola and two black one switches.&nbsp;After 
            you've hit this switches, walk over the lava and the spikes and smash 
            the hidden ice cube under the telescope.&nbsp;Hit the orange switch 
            hidden under the ice, pass the rocks, hit the checkpoint and wait 
            on the red hold switch. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now continue with the two sword gruntz 
            and the club grunt. Put the two sword gruntz onto the purple switches. 
            The club grunt proceeds to the left green hold switch beneath the 
            search light. Back to the gauntletz grunt. He goes&nbsp;upstairs, 
            passes the search light and the lava. The club grunt now steps on 
            the right green hold switch. The gauntletz grunt passes the last arrows 
            and proceeds, via the stairs, to the coin and the zap cola. Hit the 
            timer switch and proceed&nbsp;towards the stairs on the left. Pass 
            the rocks and enter the blue warp. Hit the blue toggle switch and 
            wait near the pool. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The club grunt walks back to the stairs, 
            followed by the two sword gruntz. All three gruntz pass the rolling 
            rocks, but only the sword gruntz cross the bridge. Lure one of the 
            enemy gauntletz gruntz towards you and together stab him. When all 
            gauntletz gruntz are killed, pick up the megaphone and give the toob 
            tool to your gauntletz grunt. He swims around the island, gets the 
            keg of zap cola, hits the black one switch and enters the blue warp. 
            Hit the green toggle&nbsp;switch and step on the arrows just as the 
            circling rock hits the upper row. Proceed towards the next switch, 
            step back and then forward again. Now hit the green toggle switch 
            in the middle of the next corridor, wait until the rock has&nbsp;passed 
            the two-way arrow and get the gauntletz. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Step on the red pyramids when they 
            are down, wait a moment, then on the spikes until the pyramids go 
            down again. Smash the giant ice rock and hit the black one switch 
            and </font><a href="space_w401.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">smash 
            the hidden ice cube, hit the orange switch and get the wingz.</font></a><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"> Walk around the space and hit the green toggle switch behind 
            the rolling rock. Now walk towards the breakable bridge, position 
            yourself at the right hand side and just click on the orange switch. 
            Get the gauntletz and walk back. Get the goober straw, hit the checkpoint 
            and wait. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Back to the sword gruntz, they go upstairs 
            and downstairs again passing the rolling rocks. The easiest way is 
            to walk along the holes and step on an arrow when the rocks are passing 
            by.&nbsp;The club grunt, still waiting there, now joins his friends. 
            All three gruntz proceed to the stairs, ignore the two enemy&nbsp;sponge 
            gruntz for now. One by one lure the enemy gauntletz grunt towards 
            you and stab them with the two sword&nbsp;gruntz. When you run out 
            of zap cola you can also use the club grunt, but if you hit the enemy 
            together he doesn't get the opportunity to hit you! Go upstairs and 
            kill another two enemy gauntletz gruntz. Pick up the megaphone and 
            give the shovel to the club grunt. The two sword gruntz are put onto 
            the purple switches. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The shovel grunt kills the two enemy 
            sponge gruntz. Then he proceeds towards the island, picks up the megaphone 
            and waits on the green hold switch. Give the gauntletz from the resourcez 
            to one of the sword gruntz. The gauntletz grunt smashes the giant 
            ice rock and returns to the purple switch. The sword grunt picks up 
            the shield and returns to the purple switches as well. Now the shovel 
            grunt leaves the island again. Take all the zap cola and all three 
            gruntz walk&nbsp;back towards the rolling rocks. Now the shovel grunt 
            closes all the holes in the rolling rock area.&nbsp;You appreciate 
            this later on in the level.. All three gruntz proceed to the checkpoint 
            now. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The shovel grunt enters the moving 
            pyramids maze. First hit the black one switch opposite the stairs. 
            Next the ones in&nbsp;the center, then the upper right one and finally 
            the one on the left. Leave the maze, open the holes under the rolling&nbsp;rocks 
            and hit the black one switch beneath the search light. Now close the 
            four holes and you're back at the beginning&nbsp;of the maze. Close 
            the three holes in front of the black one switch and hit it. Walk 
            to the right, pick up the megaphone and close the lower hole in front 
            of the silver pyramids. The shield grunt and the gauntletz grunt proceed 
            to the&nbsp;pyramids too. The straw grunt hits the timer switch for 
            every grunt, one by one they </font><a href="space_w402.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">walk 
            through the pyramid maze.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pick up the megaphone go downstairs 
            and position your gruntz opposite the toy plates. The last grunt picks 
            up another megaphone near the stairs. Give them all the proper toys. 
            When the search light starts moving to the left, put the squeak toy 
            grunt on the plate, then the yo-yo grunt. Finally hit the beach ball 
            plate and move back immediately, also move your other gruntz back 
            again. Now they all proceed towards the three purple switches. The 
            straw grunt hits the black one switch and sucks up the four puddlez 
            under the search light. Now return to the pyramids. One of the&nbsp;other 
            gruntz hits the timer switch and the straw grunt </font><a href="space_w402.html"><font size="2"
    face="Verdana">walks through the pyramid maze.</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Put the new grunt on the creation pad. 
            He picks up the toob tool, the baby-walker and hits the black one 
            switch. The shovel grunt proceeds to the platform with the four purple 
            switches. He closes all the holes and waits on one of the switches. 
            Now put all your other gruntz, except the gauntletz grunt, on the 
            purple switches. The gauntletz grunt smashes the ice cubes, all containing 
            a keg of zap cola, which he can reach without taking more than one 
            keg. Now he walks towards the center, steps on the arrows and gets 
            the resurrection spell. Use the spell and you got ten more gruntz! 
            You should have a total of fifteen gruntz by now. One by one the gruntz 
            take a keg of zap cola, get a tool and a toy. When you got all the 
            toolz and toyz you're ready for the final battle! </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Move all your gruntz to the final checkpoint. 
            When you position your gun hat grunt near the entrance of the pyramid&nbsp;maze, 
            you can already kill an enemy shovel grunt and wingz grunt from there. 
            Now put him opposite the enemy gauntletz grunt and you can kill him 
            too before the checkpoint goes down. When the battle is over you need 
            at least seven gruntz to finish the game. You definitely need the 
            gauntletz grunt, the shovel grunt and the sponge grunt! Position them 
            on the last three plates. Put some tough guys in front, sword, club, 
            rock and gun hat gruntz. Use your toyz and attack one enemy grunt 
            with two of your gruntz. When the pyramids go down just let them come. 
            Give one enemy a toy and together kill the other one. Don't cross 
            the blocked pyramids until the first attackers have been killed! Then 
            use the hit and run strategy to kill the enemy gun hat gruntz, finally 
            kill the enemy shovel gruntz and the last gun hat grunt near the caste. 
            Now hit the checkpoint and let the battle begin! </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Put four gruntz on the purple switches 
            around the castle. The shovel grunt enters the narrow corridor towards 
            the&nbsp;telescope and hidden behind the third pile he digs up the 
            last orange switch. Hit it, walk back and close the holes near&nbsp;the 
            castle. One of the other gruntz picks up the warpstone and waits near 
            the checkpoint.&nbsp;Now the gauntletz grunt collects the coins around 
            the castle and smashes the hidden ice cube behind the last three piles. 
            This reveals the </font><a href="space_s4.html"><font

            which gives access to </font><a href="space_r4.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana">the

    face="Verdana">the red warp</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> put some 
            gruntz on the four purple switches again.&nbsp;The gauntletz grunt 
            walks back to the castle and smashes the center bricks of the lower 
            row, he's killed. And now, for the very last time, give the warpstone 
            piece to the king. You've finished the game!</font>
