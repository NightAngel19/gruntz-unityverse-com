You may turn just about <i>anything</i> into an eyecandy or behind eyecandy. If you animate the eyecandy, it may begin to spin (this workz <u>only</u> with objectz <toyz, toolz, coinz and RBz even>). 
Using these eyecandiez to make fake thingz such as coinz, can be devious at timez. 
One way to spot the fakez from the realz is to observe their spinning. All objectz that begin revealed in a level spin synchronized, if you see an object spinning out of sync, it is fake. Make sure you know which one is fake however :(! In this case it is best to compare the object to at least 2 otherz. Note that objectz that are found under rock and holez can end up out 0f sync.
If you are going to use Toolz, Toyz, PowerUpz, Coinz, etc. as 'fakez', be advised that you will be considered unethical (at best) if those thingz may be reached without cheating!  In my "Trick Or Treat", the fakez cannot be reached legally ... which should be ample evidence that they are fake, and not worth the effort of cheating to reach them.
