The best<br/>        method for placing WayPoints is to place them outside of the outer perimenter of Brickz that are protecting the fortress.<br/>        Also, you have to make sure you place WayPoints on tiles that are "walkable" and are not covered with another object.  If<br/>        "Computer Controlled Opponents" are not leaving their GruntCreationPoints, then it usually means that you have placed<br/>        some WayPoints in bad or inaccessible locations.    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
