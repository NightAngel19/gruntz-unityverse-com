Note: This will only change the properties for the tiles in the current level.  Important: If you are using the "template levels", do not modify the tile properties for ANY tiles since they all have already been specified.  If you are starting a level from scratch, you will need to set the tile properties for approximately 300 tiles, which is why I recommend using a "template level".    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
