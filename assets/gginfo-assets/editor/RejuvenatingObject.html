A good number to use is "1000". Such a quick spawn time would make the object reappear before the grunt finishez his exclamation. This is best used with objectz <b>not</b> counted by the game engine, otherwise a PERFECT would not be possible. Health, stopwatchez, or even cursez will do well.        Using a line of rejuvenating canz of zap cola to block access to an area a RB must go is very efficient form of blockage. Previously the only way for doing this was with multiple static hazardz, a tad annoying.         The only way to get a grunt off a rejuvenating object is to use a tool that pushez gruntz around.<br/><br/></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <th colspan=2><font size="+2"><a href="EditObjects.html">Edit Objects</font> Dialog Box</a><br/><br/></th>  </tr>  <tr align="left">    <th width=11%>Logic:</th>    <th><font color="FFB903">InGameIcon</font></th>  </tr>  <tr align="left">    <th>Image Set:</th>    <td><font color="FFB903"><b>GAME_INGAMEICONZ_POWERUPZ_HEALTH1</font></th>  </tr>  <tr align="left">    <th>Damage:</th>    <th><font color="FFB903">1000</font> Is the time that it takez for the object to respawn    </th>  </tr></table></body></html>
