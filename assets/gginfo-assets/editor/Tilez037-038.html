In every graphics area, they are nothing more than grey boxes outlined in black, with their names in black.<br/>        I have never seen either of these two Tilez in any Standard Level, nor in any (released) Custom Level.  I doubt that I am alone in having used both of these Tilez in a 'work in progress' early in my experience in designing Custom Levelz, but never released with them still in it.<br/>        Best advice: Don't use these Tilez!    </th>  </tr></table></body></html>
